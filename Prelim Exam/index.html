        <p class = "text-light">What is Fine Arts?<br><br>Fine Art: Definition & Meaning
            The term "fine art" refers to an art form practised mainly for its aesthetic value and its beauty ("art for art's sake") rather than its functional value. Fine art is rooted in drawing and design-based works such as painting, printmaking, and sculpture. It is often contrasted with "applied art" and "crafts" which are both traditionally seen as utilitarian activities. Other non-design-based activities regarded as fine arts, include photography and architecture, although the latter is best understood as an applied art. </p>

        <h2>Watercolour Painting</h2>
        <p class = "text-light">What is watercolour painting?<br><br>In fine art painting, the term 'Watercolour' denotes a painting medium in which colour pigments are bound in water-soluble agents. Watercolours are a highly versatile medium, they can be applied to everything from paper to canvas, stone, wood and fabrics. Many fine versions of watercolour paintings rendered on paper, manuscripts, maps and miniatures can be found in our museums today. </p>

          <p class = "text-light">I am fond of drawing and painting since I was a child. At the beginning of my art journey, I am not that good. Yes, because no one starts at something and becomes an expert immediately. Even if no one likes my artworks, I still appreciate my works and keep on doing it. People's compliments add up to the happiness and peace I feel when I draw.</p>
